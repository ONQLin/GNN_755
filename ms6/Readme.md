1. Copy `outputs` directory from MS4 to MS6 \
Also copy `top.sdc` from MS3 to MS6/outputs, becasue the sdc file from MS4 generated by Cadence Innovus has compatibility issues with PrimeTime tool \
Please double check the line 77 of `.synopsys_pt.setup`, which is the db files path in MS3

2. Source the environment using the following commands (once in each new terminal)
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/cae/apps/data/synopsys-2021/lc/S-2021.06/linux64/nwtn/shlib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
export TERM=xterm-basic
source /cae/apps/env/synopsys-PrimeTime-2021

3. Run primetime
pt_shell -f ./pt_script.tcl 
   - The screen output is captured into ./pt_shell_command.log

4. Check reports and outputs
   - Examine logs, timing and power reports in `./reports`

5. Obtain the area(um^2) from Primetime (reports/pt.area.rpt)

6. To obtain maximum operating frequency:
	- Change the clock period in `outputs/top.sdc` and follow step 3 and step 4 above until it throws timing violations in reports.
        - Reduce the period and corresponding number inside 'waveform' to increase the clock frequency in the line  
        "create_clock [get_ports clk]  -period 10  -waveform {0 5}"
        In the above example, the clock period is 10 ns, i.e. the frequency is 100 MHz. To double the frequency, the line should be changed to
        "create_clock [get_ports clk]  -period 5  -waveform {0 2.5}"

7. Obtain the number of clock cycles (#cycles) it takes to produce the output. You have to get it from simulation (ModelSim/QuestSim etc).

8. Obtain the end-to-end latency (ns) by #cycles*1000/max frequency (in MHz)

9. Obtain the power (W) from reports/pt.hier_power.rpt (total power; unit is in W) while simulated at the highest possible frequency.

10. The submission guidelines are in the ECE755 project spec pdf
